# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe AI (Java Swing)

A desktop-based **Tic Tac Toe game with AI** built using **Java Swing**, featuring a modern GUI and an intelligent CPU opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.
---

## ✨ Features

* 🧠 **AI-powered opponent** using the Minimax algorithm
* 🎨 **Custom GUI design**
* 🔄 **Restart/New Game button**
* 🏆 Game status (Win / Lose / Tie)
* 🖥️ Fully **offline desktop application**
* 📦 Clean, single-file Java implementation (easy to extend)

---

## 🧠 AI Logic (Overview)

The CPU uses the **Minimax algorithm** to:

* Evaluate all possible game states
* Maximize its winning chances
* Minimize the player's chances

This makes the AI **strategic and competitive**, ensuring meaningful gameplay rather than random moves.
